# Demo App

##  Introductionï¼š

The Demo APP mainly demonstrates the SDK development process. Before developing the APP, it is recommended to complete the Demo App operation according to this document.

After completing the [Integration Preparation](./Preparation.md) chapter, you will obtain the `AppKey`, `AppSecret`, and security picture information used by the SDK. When integrating the SDK, please confirm whether the `AppKey`, `AppSecret`, and security image are consistent with the information on the platform. Any mismatch will cause the SDK to be unusable.
